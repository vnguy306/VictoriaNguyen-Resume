        <div class="subheading mb-5">Business AdministrationðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">As a current business major at the University of California, Riverside I am currently working towards a Business Administration degree with a concentration in management. Later on in my undergraduate education, I plan to also work towards a minor in political science. After my undergraduate education, I plan on attending a graduate law school and later pursuing a career in law. At this time, I am currently deciding between being a criminal attorney or a civic attorney. Along with being a full time student, I am also a member of the Academic Affairs Committee. The Academic Affairs Committee operates under the Office of the Vice President of Internal Affairs in the schoolâ€™s undergraduate student government, the Associated Students of the University of California, Riverside.<br><br>

        Prior to my studies at the University of California, Riverside, I was a student at Beckman High School. During my time at Beckman High School, I was the color guard Lieutenant along with being the President and Founder of the Beckman Wounded Warriors club. I have also been recognized as a Tru Blu student, which is an award given to students who are nominated by a teacher for demonstrating the characteristics of: pride, kindness, responsibility, acceptance, individuality, involvement, integrity, optimism, leadership, commitment, loyalty, honor, and punctuality. Outside of school, I was the distinguished student and  class President of the Administration of Justice class through the Regional Occupation Program. In the prior semester, I was the class Vice President of the Crime Scene Investigation class. At the end of my senior year in high school, I was able to graduate as a life time member of Beckmanâ€™s California Scholarship Federation chapter and the seal of biliteracy for English and Spanish. <br><br>

        Outside of my studies and academics, I have always had a passion for helping others. Following this passion, I have been a volunteer for the Discovery Cube of Orange County, a summer camp counselor for the Discovery Cube in partnership with the Santa Ana Zoo, and I would volunteer as a classroom aid for Woodbury Elementary School. In the duration of my volunteering with these two organizations, I earned a Presidential Volunteer Service Award and the Discovery Cubeâ€™s July 2019 volunteer of the month. In my spare time, I enjoy embroidery, calligraphy, and arts and crafts among many creative outlets to design and make art. Some skills that I am able to offer future employers include: organization, basic graphic design through programs such as Adobe Photoshop, social media management, an intermediate understanding of Microsoft office, and leadership skills.
